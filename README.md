Overview of the project:
PROJECT:Sentiment analysis in NLP
objective:
The objective of this Project is to sentiment analysis on amazon reviews dataset. This project analysizes the emotion behind the text using VADER method
Steps_Involving:
1)Data Collection:Gather text data from various sources like social media, reviews, surveys, etc
2)Text Preprocessing: 
       * Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or phrases.
       * Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.
       * Stop Words Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute much to meaning (e.g., "the", "and").
3)Feature Extraction:
       * Bag of Words: Represents text data as a collection of word frequencies.
       * TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighs the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
       *  Word Embeddings: Using pre-trained models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText to convert words into vector representations.
4)Model Selection:
       * Choose between lexicon-based, machine learning, or deep learning approaches.
       * Train the model on labeled data if using machine learning or deep learning methods.
5) Sentiment Analysis:
       * Apply the model to analyze the sentiment of new text data.
       * Calculate sentiment scores or classifications.
6) Visualization and Reporting:
Technology used:
Lexicon-Based Tools: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): Designed for social media text.  
Machine Learning-Based Tools: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Provides a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing.  

Python- python is widely used for data preprocessing due to its extensive libraries
Pandas- essential library for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy- used for numerical computing and handling arrays
scikit-learn- provides range of supervisied and unsupervisied learing algorithms
Importance
Data preprocessing is vital as it directly impacts the performance and accuracy of machine learning models.By ensuring data is clean,consistent and properly formatted, data processing helps in building robust models that provide reliable and meaningful insights.
